    <h2><u>Self-Check Quiz</u></h2>

  
    <p>A1. STRING </p>
    
    <P>A2. NUMBER</P>

    <p>A3. In general, it's a good practice to use undefined when a variable is expected to have a value in the future
        but doesn't at the moment, and use null when you want to explicitly say that there's no value.
    </p>
  
    <p>A4. The console output for the given JavaScript code will be:

        <b>"world"</b>
    </p>

    <p>A5. The code you provided will log the following text to the console:

        Hello world!
    </p>



    <p> A6. The prompt function displays a dialog box that allows the user to input text, and the value they enter will
        be stored in the variable a.</p>

    
    <p> A7.
        The value of b output to the console will be 71.</p>


    <p>A8.
        The value of result will be 4.

        In this expression, JavaScript follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means it performs the
        multiplication and division before addition. So, it first calculates 4 * 2 / 8, which equals 1, and then adds 3
        to it, resulting in 4. Therefore, result will be 4.</p>


<p>A9. The console.log(total) statement prints the value of total, which is 16.<Br>
    The console.log(total2) statement prints the value of total2, which is 536.

    <p>A10.
        In summary, the following will be logged to the console:
        <br>
        true <br>
        false  <br>
        true <br>
        true <br>
        false <br>
